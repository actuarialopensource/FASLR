Contributing
=============

There are two main ways to contribute

======================
Contributing to FASLR
======================

Users who are interested in contributing to FASLR are free to open pull requests on the `project GitHub <https://github.com/casact/FASLR/pulls>`_.

There is currently no roadmap, and as this is a community volunteer effort, I don't feel comfortable telling people exactly what to do. The closest thing to a roadmap would be the `issues <https://github.com/casact/FASLR/issues>`_ page that lists the open tickets.

Feel free to volunteer for a ticket by commenting in one, and I will assign it to you. If you'd like new features to be added, you should create your own ticket.

==================================
Contributing to the documentation
==================================

The documentation source code is located in the `docs folder <https://github.com/casact/FASLR/tree/main/docs>`_. It comprises of .rst files, and you should use Sphinx to render them. Media such as images and videos are stored outside of the repository on a separate server to save space - so any pull requests should not include these types of media.


=================
Discussion Board
=================

Topics, and questions that don't fit neatly into a ticket can be discussed on the project's `discussion board <https://github.com/casact/FASLR/discussions>`_.

=================
Project finances
=================

I am currently not accepting funding. Aside from the my own free time and that of the volunteers, current costs are $5/month to host this website.

Further costs may include the commissioning of artwork for things like themes and logos, but that will come at a later time.
