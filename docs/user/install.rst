Setup and Installation
=======================

FASLR is in the early stages of development. As such, rapid implementation of features has been prioritized over the stability of the user experience. There are currently no binary executables available. People who are interested in seeing what FASLR can do as well as potential contributors will, for the time being, need to run FASLR from source.

=======================
Cloning the Repository
=======================

The first step in using FASLR is to clone the repository from the `CAS GitHub <https://github.com/casact/>`_. This can be done by opening a terminal, navigating to the directory where you want to keep the repo, and then running the command:

.. code-block:: shell

   git clone https://github.com/casact/faslr
