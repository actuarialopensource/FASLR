Creating a New Project
======================

To begin a reserve study, you must create a project. Projects are organized hierarchically: **Country -> State -> Line of Business**. That is, a country may contain multiple states, and a state may have multiple lines of business.

To create a project, navigate to **Main Menu -> File -> New Project**. A dialog box will appear asking you to fill out the project's hierarchical information. Note that you must be :doc:`connected <connecting>` to a database for the New Project menu action to be active:

After filling out the information and clicking **OK**, your new project should appear in the :doc:`Project Tree <../../interface/project>` on the left side of the :doc:`Main Window <../../interface/main>`.
