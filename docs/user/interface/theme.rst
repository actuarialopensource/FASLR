Theming
=======

FASLR's default theme is the Qt Fusion theme. There are plans to also include a dark mode theme, as noted in `this ticket <https://github.com/casact/FASLR/issues/28>`_.

Since work should be enjoyable, it is my intention to make FASLR theming as customizable for the user. Those who are interested in making their own custom themes may do so by taking advantage of Qt's QSS functionality.
