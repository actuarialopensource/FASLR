Main Menu
=========

The main menu is the set of dropdown menus right underneath the :doc:`Main Window <main>` title bar. These are used for managing database connections and configuring FASLR itself, such as modifying user settings. The menus are:

- File: Used to connect to databases, for creating new projects, and editing user settings.
- Edit: Used for clipboard operations, such as copying and pasting.
- Tools: Used for changing the underlying calculation engine (right now, only `chainladder-python <https://github.com/casact/chainladder-python>`_ is supported).
- Help: Displays program information, such as version, and links to the `FASLR GitHub repository <https://github.com/casact/faslr>`_.
