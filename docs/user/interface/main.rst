Main Window
===========

The Main Window is the first thing you see when you run FASLR. It consists of three main sections:

#. Main Menu
#. Project Tree
#. Analysis Pane

The main menu is used to access various dialogs to configure FASLR. The project tree is used for browsing and selecting projects, and the analysis pane is where most of the work is done. It is used to browse project data, build reserving models, and compile reports. More information about these sections can be found by navigating to their respective articles.
