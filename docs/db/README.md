# Schema documentation instructions

## Requirements

The schema documentation is generated by schemaspy:  https://schemaspy.org/.

```shell
wget https://github.com/schemaspy/schemaspy/releases/download/v6.2.3/schemaspy-6.2.3.jar
```

A sqlite JDBC driver is required:


https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc

```shell
https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/releases/download/3.42.0.0/sqlite-jdbc-3.42.0.0.jar
```

This needs Java to run, currently I have openjdk 11 installed on the Linode instance.

Commands to render the documentation and move the files to the correct place on the server are in the second half of the build_docs.sh file.

Instructions on how to ssh into the Linode via GitHub Actions can be found here:
